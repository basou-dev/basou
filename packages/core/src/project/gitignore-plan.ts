 * Plan the agent instruction-file `.gitignore` entries a declared repo needs

 * the agent instruction files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, …) must be GITIGNORED so the
 * gitignored symlinks to the private canonical never enter public git history.
 * `basou project gitignore` reconciles each repo's `.gitignore` to that; this is
 * the pure planner behind it.
 *
 * Pure: it diffs the REQUIRED patterns against the repo's CURRENT `.gitignore`
 * lines (both gathered by the caller) and reports only what is MISSING — it never
 * proposes removing a line. The realpath / file reading / writing is the caller's
 * job. The privacy decision is visibility-aware: only public / future-public
 * repos require the patterns (a private anchor may legitimately track its
 * canonical), and a repo with unset visibility is skipped (reported), never
 * acted on by guesswork.
